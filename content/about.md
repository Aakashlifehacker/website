If you have a SaaS idea, you should have the freedom and confidence to pursue it. If you have a desire to work on your own terms, spend more time with your family and escape the rat race, your idea could be your ticket to freedom.

But sadly, reality likes to throw us obstacles. Mostly in the form of time. You work long structured hours, you have a family, and you’re working on other projects, so how can you possibly find the time to develop your idea? Time is the biggest killer of ideas.

That’s why we’re building Budibase -  to reduce the time it takes to develop your SaaS idea into an application people love. We’re removing tedious repetition, taking care of hosting, and providing you with a platform to manage your users.

This is just the beginning. We eventually want to add additional functionality to improve the usability of the product, and we’ll continue to reduce the time it takes to build SaaS applications.

We’re bringing together a solid team and the power of open source to develop Budibase, develop the SaaS ecosystem, and develop the world’s SaaS ideas into applications. Jump on board.
