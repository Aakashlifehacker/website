I'm often thinking of SaaS ideas for my next project but most of the time they are either rubbish or I don't have the capacity to pursue them. 

Instead of throwing all the good ideas away, I've decided to share them with you - how thoughtful, right :smile:

This post is not a simple static list; create, posted, and forgot about. I will revisit this list on a monthly basis, delivering you super-fresh ideas to feed your entrepreneurial hunger.



## What is Micro SaaS

**A Micro SaaS business or product focuses on solving a problem in a niche market, using minimal resource.** 

The term was originally coined by [Tyler Tringas](https://tylertringas.com/) when describing his business Storemapper. His definition goes into  more detail, and explains how a Micro SaaS business should comprises of a small team, with small costs, and a small dedicated user base. 



## 5 Benefits of a Micro SaaS business



1. ### Freedom

   If your Micro SaaS business is somewhat successful, you can explore the freedom of working for yourself. Leaving the 9-5 rat race is an objective for many; a Micro SaaS business could be your ticket out of it. With owning your own business, you have the freedom and autonomy of doing things your own way - no more apathy or bureaucracy.

   On top of that, you are your own boss. You can work and relax whenever and wherever you want. You can decide to climb Kilimanjaro or spend more time with your family, the decision is yours.

2. ###Speed

   Building a Micro SaaS business is a lot less intensive than building larger SaaS apps. It's also made a lot easier and quicker with [SaaS App Builders](https://www.budibase.com) .  Micro SaaS app MVPs can be built at lightning speeds - sometimes [under 24 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DexyfHomC4Q) . Building and validating an MVP is quicker with less features and a focused market. Failure, as much as we don't want to talk about it, is easier to cope with due to the level of investment, compared to a large SaaS app.

3. ###Income

4. ###Support

5. ### Ownership













### Time Leverage: The Magic of Recurring Revenue

You can get some of the above benefits of location independence and owning a craft from any remote software business but there’s something special about SaaS. Recurring revenue is unequivocally the most powerful revenue model in the world today. Evergreen content, ebooks, drop-shipping, affiliate deals, AdSense, ecommerce, all seem incredibly risky compared to knowing that the vast majority of the customers that paid you last month, will pay you the same amount again the next month and very likely the month after. Once recurring revenue reaches a comfortable level, that predictability allows you the flexibility to start spending less and less time on your Micro-SaaS while still making the same or more money. I doubt it’s possible to get it down to zero (the mythical “passive income”), but it’s certainly within reach to make as much money as a full-time salary on 15, 10 or even FOUR (wink wink) hours a week. SaaS can be a business that not only yields money, but starts to give you back your time. Of course you don’t have to spend less time on it but having that option gives you much more control over the time vs money equation in your life.

Here are a few things I was able to do over the last few years thanks to my Micro-SaaS:

- Freelance 20-30 hours per week for several periods on top of running the business solo, which combined with my SaaS income allowed me to make twice as much money in a month as I ever had before.
- [Pay down nearly $60,000 in debt](http://tylertringas.com/debt-free/) (from a previous failed startup) in less than two years.
- Travel the world for a year with my girlfriend. Rather burning through savings I actually netted a good profit on the year despite spending months in areas with virtually no internet connection.
- Move back to the US and devote the majority of my working week to projects that I find interesting, like writing this ebook, without having to worry whether they would generate any revenue.

### Building a Financial Launchpad

Venture backed startups still get all the attention these days while bootstrapped and profitable “lifestyle businesses” are deemed unworthy of unambitious and talented people. But if you dig back in the histories of really successful founders, you very often find they had already secured a high level of financial security before they ever built a world-changing risky startup. Stories of founders truly putting their entire financial future on the line before coming out on top will achieve almost mythical status, but they are by far the exception to the rule. Most world-changing founders had a more boring traditional business success first, or more commonly came from wealthy families who could backstop their risk.

During the same period of my life that I built my Micro-SaaS, I bootstrapped, raised angel funding for, and [ultimately was forced to close a venture-scale startup](http://tylertringas.com/closing-solarlist-a-cleantech-post-mortem/). It was the most stressful thing I have ever done and it did damage to almost every other aspect of my life: relationships, health, sanity, bank account. I really did put my entire financial future on the line, getting enormously in debt and without a backup plan.

I doubt that will be my last attempt at a legacy-building company, but I have learned my lesson. The biggest problem by far in my first attempt was that the moment I quit my job, my income evaporated. I was trying to run a startup while drawing down on my meager savings and frantically trying to raise more funding just to pay for rent and groceries on top of business expenses.

Now that I own a Micro-SaaS business, I can work on a new startup without drawing a paycheck indefinitely and it is absolutely the route I would recommend to any aspiring startup founder in a similar financial situation. You can also replace “startup” with anything ambitious and risky. A Micro-SaaS business could fund you while you spend six month writing a novel or trying to make it big in the acting or music business. One Micro-SaaS founder I know used it to pay the bills while starting a travel publishing business.

If you are interested in starting a big risky ambitious project some day, Micro-SaaS could be the perfect launchpad.
