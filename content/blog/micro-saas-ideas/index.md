## What is Micro SaaS

> **A Micro SaaS business or product focuses on solving a problem in a niche market, using minimal resource.** 

There are multiple definitions for Micro SaaS on the web but they're often convoluted and elaborate. To save you a sore head, we thought we'd provide our own, simplified definition. 

The term 'Micro SaaS' was originally coined by [Tyler Tringas](https://tylertringas.com/) when describing his business Storemapper, a few years back.

Ultimately, a Micro SaaS business comprises of a small team, with small costs, and a small dedicated user base. It's about keeping things minimal and controlled, as you probably guessed.



## Benefits of owning a Micro SaaS business

Building a Micro SaaS business has obvious benefits such as income and ownership. But, today, we'd like to quickly explore 3 other lesser-known perks to help encourage you to get started. üëä

#### Freedom

When your new Micro SaaS business is successful, you can explore the freedom of working for yourself - more family time, days off when you want, and control. 

No more apathy or bureaucracy - you make the decisions, you rule the roost! 

Leaving the 9-5 rat race is an objective for many and a Micro SaaS business is a super-quick way out of it.

#### Speed

As the name suggests Micro SaaS businesses are small, involving less resources and often less functionality. 

[SaaS App Builders](https://www.budibase.com) can do a lot of the leg work for a Micro SaaS app.  MVPs are developed at lightning-fast speeds - sometimes [under 24 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DexyfHomC4Q) ‚ö°Ô∏è. 

Also, building and validating an MVP is quicker with a focused market üôå.

#### Support

With less functionality, a focused solution, and a niche market, support is easier to manage. 

This is huge benefit to Micro SaaS businesses as support is usually one of the heaviest resources in regards to time and expenditure.

## Micro SaaS Ideas üëè

Blood, sweat and tears were poured whilst creating and documenting these ideas. They are yours to copy and use freely however you please. I hope they bring you joy, fortune and potential project to get your teeth into.



### 1. CRM For Freelancers

{{< figure src="/freelancercrm.jpg" alt="Freelance CRM" >}}

> The freelance market is growing rapidly, with Forbes reporting half of the US workforce will be freelance by 2020.  [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2017/10/17/are-we-ready-for-a-workforce-that-is-50-freelance/)

This figure is a little optimistic but you get the idea - the market is growing fast. This influx in demand is due to the low labour costs which makes freelancers an attractive proposition for over 66% of large organisations.

#### Problem

Freelancers are super busy working, networking and learning new skills such as marketing, sales, design, administration, finance, account management. When juggling so many tasks, its very easy to lose track of things. For some freelancers, life is stressful and unsystematic - as a cluttered freelancer for 5 years, I can wholeheartedly vouch for this.

#### Solution

A CRM designed for freelancers would help organise and pinpoint areas for growth. Simplicity is important and this is where normal CRMs don't quite cut it - they're over complicated and make a lot of assumptions. The functionality required for a simple CRM includes; a filterable contact list (name, company, phone number, email, notes, contract worth), a pipeline, and tasks. Integrating with an email marketing platform would be beneficial. The CRM should also be accessible on mobile - freelancers are busy people and are often on the road.

#### Competition

There are lots of CRMs out there but your biggest competitor is probably not a CRM at all. It's potentially an Excel or Google Spreadsheet - which is great as we both know their limitations. Other potential competitors include Zoho CRM which is free but extremely excessive in its functionality.

#### Demand

We can confirm the term 'freelance crm' receives around 390 searches per month on Google.

### 2. Content Scheduler

Just look at the sheer velocity surrounding the popularity of podcasts.
