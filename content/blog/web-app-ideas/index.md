## Web app ideas to make money

### 1. CRM for startups / small businesses

A CRM is a platform which helps you manage relationships with customers.

The CRM market is super competitive with lots of big names, such as Salesforce and Hubspot, competing for business. 

But don't let this deter you. These guys are after medium - enterprise businesses.

Your new CRM web app will target freelancers / startups / small businesses. I've covered the potential of a freelance CRM before in my [micro saas ideas] post.

I'm pretty confident people are searching for startup CRMs. Just look at the amount of people following this Quora post:

Building a CRM for startups isn't a great deal of work, and you could have an MVP up and running in a week.

The key to building a CRM for startups is to keep is super simple. This is what will differentiate your CRM from your competitors. 

Startups are busy, they need quick access to their customers, and a few features and that's all. Simplicity is key, and it's what your market wants.

### 2. The CEO dashboard

A dashboard web app is the most popular request we receive from signups to [Budibase](https://www.budibase.com). Dashboards are in demand and the trend is on the rise.

We have access to more data than ever. But the problem is not access no more, it's interpretation.

A dashboard provides a simple view for easy and fast analysis.

When working for B2B SaaS companies, my CEO's would always pester me. They continuously wanted to know the latest marketing / product metrics. This would kill my flow.

Every manager in the company felt this pain.

And where's the pain, there's opportunity.

A CEO dashboard would provide CEOs with a nice view of all their chosen metrics. This would keep CEOs always informed, and relieve managers / staff from the clutches of the 'flow killer'.

Dashboards are in demand and the landscape is not too competitive.

Building a CEO dashboard would allow you room to differentiate and solve a major (personal) problem. It will be tricky, but the potential is worth it.
