The world is eating software. üåé üç¥üåê 

The above is a tongue-and-cheek response to the famous words of Marc Andreessen, 'software is eating the world'. Marc's words hail from his wondrous post, dated 2011, and titled [Why software is eating the world](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/). 

In 2011, software was eating the world. A new wave of digital pathfinders were developing and launching innovative software which would inevitably take the internet by storm. We had the surgence of companies such as Amazon, Hubspot, Mailchimp, Salesforce, Pipedrive, and so on. Companies excitedly swarmed to these platforms and equipped themselves with newfound superpowers. The digital revolution was upon us. Productivity hit new heights, the startup ecosystem exploded, and the term 'SaaS' was proudly voiced in every board room. 

For years, the momentum continued. A few built for many. It was great; transformational in many cases. But it wasn't enough and it isn't enough. We're crossed the chasm, and we want more. We want software to be specific to our needs and problems, and we're more hungry than ever. Sadly, there's not enough developers to keep up with demand. Generic COTS (commerical of the shelf) software will continue to grace of balance sheets, as will the rising cost of developers. But, change is upon us. A new era of custom software development is here An era which expands the power of creation, is specific to the needs of the consumer, and is economical. 

Where a few, build for a few. 

But first, let's make sure we are on the same page.

In the last 30 years, custom software development was primarily utilised within
