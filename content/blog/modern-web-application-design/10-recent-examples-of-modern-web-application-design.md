Every once in a while, I'll come across examples of web application design that really draw me in. I've listed these web applications below and ranked them from 5 - 1.

These web applications contain a beautiful mix of design, usability and creativity. They are masterpieces, and wonderful tokens of inspiration.

Huge amounts of time and thought have went into the design of these web applications, and credit must go to the designs. Under each design, I will list the design. If you like their web application design below, I recommend you check out their other work too.

## What Is Web Application Design

Web application design is an important stage when building a web application. It focuses on the look and feel of the web application. 

The design stage encompasses several different aspects, including user interface design (UI), usability (UX), content production, and graphic design.

### What is UI in Web Application?

UI stands for User Interface. UI is the part of the web application which a user interacts with. It simple terms, it's everything you see and touch, such as buttons, colours, fonts, navigation, etc.

### What is UX in Web Application?



UX stands for User Experience. UX focuses on how the users feels towards the application, and their experience using it. Was the web application hard to use, was it slow, was the user disappointed when using it? These are the types of questions a UX designer will focus on when reviewing web applications.

### 5. Netlify

{{< figure src="/web-app-design/netlify.PNG" alt="Netlify UI" >}}

Netlify takes the complicated and makes it simple. 

Netlify offers hosting and severless backend solutions to static websites. 

My first experience with Netlify was in 2017. Before Netlify, I used AWS to host my static websites. 

Within the first 2 minutes of using Netlify I was in shock. How could this painstaking process, which I frequently fret upon, become so easy? 

The answer, DESIGN. 

Every screen/feature is clearly explained and beautifully structured. Their tables, fonts, and navigation are beautiful to look at and use. Information is only presented when it needs to be. Unlike AWS, you feel comfortable and in control.

In 2017, I'm pretty confident I was Netlify's best sales person. I referred it to all my social circles, singing its praises when possible.



### 4. Intercom

{{< figure src="/web-app-design/intercom.png" alt="Intercom UI" >}}

Intercom describes their company as a suite of messaging-first products, designed to accelerate business growth. Founded in 2011, the Intercom suite of products have went through multiple design iterations, including most recently, in March 2019.

The most recent design attracted a lot of praise, and also negative dribble from the darker corners of the internet - but we're going to ignore the trolls as we're huge fans.



### 3. AirBnB



### 2. Notion

{{< figure src="/web-app-design/notion.png" alt="Notion UI" >}}

I am a huge fan on Notion, and I've been an avid user since 2016. It's minimalist and uncluttered feel, provides the user with a blank canvas, free from distraction. 

When I first used the web app in 2016, it was slow and unresponsive in some cases. I wasn't the only person to feel this, and it ultimately led to a complete rebuild of the product.

Thankfully, the rebuild paid off. Notion is now used by over 1,000,000 users and performs flawlessly. 

For me, Notion was my number 1 pick for the best example of modern web application design. 

Well done to Notion, who recently  raised a tiny $10 million against an $800 million evaluation. 

*Budibase is similar to Notion. Both platforms aim to bring the power of databases to the less technical. You could, in fact, build a platform similar to Notion using Budibase - a personal side-project for Budibase cofounder, Mike.*

### 1. Mailchimp
