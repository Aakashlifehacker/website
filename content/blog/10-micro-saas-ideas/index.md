## What is Micro SaaS

> **A Micro SaaS business or product focuses on solving a problem in a niche market, using minimal resource.** 

There are multiple definitions for Micro SaaS on the web but they're often convoluted and elaborate. To save you a sore head, we thought we'd provide our own, simplified definition. 

The term 'Micro SaaS' was originally coined by [Tyler Tringas](https://tylertringas.com/) when describing his business Storemapper, a few years back.

Ultimately, a Micro SaaS business comprises of a small team, with small costs, and a small dedicated user base. It's about keeping things minimal and controlled, as you probably guessed.



## Benefits of owning a Micro SaaS business

Building a Micro SaaS business has obvious benefits such as income and ownership. But, today, we'd like to quickly explore 3 other lesser-known perks to help encourage you to get started. üëä

### Freedom

When your new Micro SaaS business is successful, you can explore the freedom of working for yourself - more family time, days off when you want, and control. 

No more apathy or bureaucracy - you make the decisions, you rule the roost! 

Leaving the 9-5 rat race is an objective for many and a Micro SaaS business is a super-quick way out of it.

### Speed

As the name suggests Micro SaaS businesses are small, involving less resources and often less functionality. 

[SaaS App Builders](https://www.budibase.com) can do a lot of the leg work for a Micro SaaS app.  MVPs are developed at lightning-fast speeds - sometimes [under 24 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DexyfHomC4Q) ‚ö°Ô∏è. 

Also, building and validating an MVP is quicker with a focused market üôå.

### Support

With less functionality, a focused solution, and a niche market, support is easier to manage. 

This is huge benefit to Micro SaaS businesses as support is usually one of the heaviest resources in regards to time and expenditure.
