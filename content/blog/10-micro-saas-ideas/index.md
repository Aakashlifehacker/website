Instead of throwing all the good ideas away, I've decided to share them with you - how thoughtful, right :smile:

This post is not a simple static list; create, posted, and forgot about. I will revisit and update the list on a monthly basis, delivering you super-fresh ideas to feed your entrepreneurial hunger.

## What is Micro SaaS

> **A Micro SaaS business or product focuses on solving a problem in a niche market, using minimal resource.** 


The term was originally coined by [Tyler Tringas](https://tylertringas.com/) when describing his business Storemapper. 

His definition goes into  more detail, and explains how a Micro SaaS business should comprises of a small team, with small costs, and a small dedicated user base. 

Before we serve you our ten ideas, it's important to outline 3 important benefits of owning a Micro SaaS business (other than income).



I'm pretty sure you'll like them.



## Benefits of owning a Micro SaaS business

### Freedom

When your new Micro SaaS business is successful, you can explore the freedom of working for yourself - more family time, days off when you want, and control. 

No more apathy or bureaucracy - you make the decisions, you rule the roost! 

Leaving the 9-5 rat race is an objective for many and a Micro SaaS business is a super-quick way out of it.

### Speed

As the name suggests Micro SaaS businesses are small, involving less resources and often less functionality. 

It's also made a lot easier and quicker with [SaaS App Builders](https://www.budibase.com) .  MVPs are built at lightning speeds - sometimes [under 24 hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DexyfHomC4Q) . 

Also, building and validating an MVP is quicker with a focused market.

### Support

With less functionality, a focused solution, and a niche market, support is easier to manage. 

This is huge benefit to Micro SaaS businesses as support is usually one of the heaviest resources in regards to time and expenditure.
