While it is early to say if no code tools can completely replace talented developers, having the right no code stack can certainly help you get the job done a lot faster, easier and cheaper.

There are hundreds of no code tools available, some free or cheap and some very expensive. They also serve tons of different purposes, from 3rd party integrations to building web applications and more. The no code landscape is attracting a lot of interest, and is growing year on year.

This is exciting, since it means that if you have a development problem, you can probably find a no code tool to help you solve it. But itâ€™s also overwhelming. How do you know which of the couple hundred tools are worth trying and investing in?

This post will help clarify those decisions for you. Weâ€™ll outline the top 10 no code tools in 2020. Each tool has its own specific use case, so please pay attention to the purpose of the tool - this will ensure you choose the right tool, for the right job.



## What is no code

For those of you who are wondering 'what is no code?', let me explain. Software is built using code. This has not changed. What has changed, is how that code is produced.

Traditionally, code is produced by a developer / programmer writing it, using an IDE (integrated development environment). Writing code is a difficult skill, and takes years to master. On top of that, in most scenarios there are more than one programming language and framework to learn, which adds the to intensity.

With no code tools, you can build a web app, website, database, etc without having to write code. No code tools replace coding with ... clicking. In most cases, the user interacts with a GUI (graphic user interface). This method of building software is sometimes referred to as visual programming, it is not a new concept.

Truth be told, I am not a fan of the phrase no-code because it is wrong. Code powers the internet, and always will. What no code stands for, is more of a movement and set of tools. 'No coding' is more appropriate and even that is not technically correct. A short description can be found below:

> No-code is a method of programming which involves building web technologies with GUI-based tools, instead of writing code. 



## History

If you studied computer science or ICT in the late 90s / early 00's you will fondly ðŸ˜œ remember [Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/dreamweaver.html) and [Frontpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage). These tools were groundbreaking in their time and many peoples' first experience of a no code tool. I built my first website with Frontpage and it looked terrible, but it was a live website on the internet which was a success ðŸŽ‰. Sadly, I don't have a picture of my website, but thankfully you can catch a glimpse of Frontpage below.



## Evolution

No-code tools have improved immensely. Just about anyone can build a website with tools such as Carrd. There are entrepreneurs, marketers and designers building production ready web apps without the assistance of a developer - which is an incredible feat. Long-gone are the days when only a programmer could build things for the internet. 



## No-code movement

We are at the beginning of a revolution. As more people gain access to the internet and no code tools continue to remove technical barriers, an innumerable amount of makers and entrepeneurs will be born. This will bring opportunity. It will open doors to subject matter experts, and allow people to build and test PoCs quickly and cost-effectively. It will change many lives, and level numerous playing fields. It will, to a degree, democratise software development.

1. Budibase
2. Zapier
3. IFTTT
4. Airtable
5. Typeform
6. Shopify
7. Webflow
8. Carrd
9. Payhere
10. Stripe

### 1. Budibase

[Budibase](https://www.budibase.com) is the new and better way to design, build and launch SaaS applications. In other words, with Budibase you can create SaaS without coding. It's also a great tool for creating proof of concepts quickly. On top of that, it's workflow section makes it the perfect tool for creating internal tools within a business setting; leading to efficiency savings. 

Budibase is different from other no code tools - it's open source and free to download and use. Budibase believes if a person is going to create their business on a tool, they should have full control over that tool, and the confidence it will always be around - long term viability is more important than most people think.



### 2. Zapier

Zapier describe their platform as the glue that connects thousands of web apps. I have used Zapier countless times and it's always been a great experience. You can chain commands together, which is great for automation. For example, before Zapier, someone would complete a lead generation form on our website and we would take that informaton and manually add it to Hubspot. With Zapier, this is automatically done for us - and it only took 2 minutes to setup.

Zapier has opened the door for many entrepeneurs, makers, startups to integrate their platforms with other popular web apps; which might not have been possible before. Intregrating applications with code is tough, but thankfully Zapier makes it easy and possible with a just a few clicks. 

Zapier now have over 2000 integrations, including web apps such as Google Sheets, Mailchimp, Hubspot. It offers a few plan, but there are limitations. With the free tier you get 100 tasks per month and you can only have 5 Zaps running at the same time. This is fine for light use and testing the platform, but for popular automations you will quickly find yourself running into limitations. The next tier up - Starter - provides you with 750 tasks per month, and 20 Zaps for $19.99.



### 3. IFTTT

IFTTT stands for 'If this then that'. IFTTT is similar to Zapier, chaining together simple conditional statements to help users automate tasks. One key difference between both Zapier and IFTTT, is Zapier can handle multiple triggers and actions, and it also has more integrations. But, in my opion, IFTTT's UI is perfect for beginners and simple automations making it great for hobbyists. 

IFTTT is free to use. If you would like to publish an integration with IFTTT, you will have to pay them an annual fee.



### 4. Airtable

Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid and is often referred to as a management app due to its productivity features. Airtable gives you the functionality of a database, with the UI of a spreadsheet which is great for beginners. Airtable is online, and allows you to collaborate with your colleagues which makes communication easier. From a database perspective, Airtable is simple to use and offers many integrations with other platforms. All-in-all Airtable is a great platform for building database-focused internal tools. It also benefits from a popular template marketplace called Universe which is incredibly helpful.

Airtable is free to use until you hit 1,200 records. The free tier is also limited to 2GB of attachment space and 2 weeks history. The next tier up is the plus tier and will cost you $20 / user / month. With this tier you can benefit from 5,000 records, 5GB attachment space and 6 months history.



### 5. Typeform

With a beautiful UI and conversational approach to collecting information, Typeform is the perfect no-code tool for creating forms and surveys. Having used Typeform, it is very easy to get started and simple to use. Typeform integrates with over 500 applications allowing you to send your data to multiple end points. The forms produced by Typeform are professional and usable leading to high conversion rates.









## Realistic

I would like to point out, no code tools can get you far, and in some cases in the entire way for your use case. But please do not dispell the important of code and developers. For now, there are still a lot of areas of build web apps and databases which require coding, and possibly a developer or some good documentation.
