## Understand Your Target Market (Keyword Research)

"Not that old chestnut again", I hear you say. 

Yes, we are going back to marketing 101 but this is a little different.

Before building your website, writing your content marketing strategy, or shooting your next YouTube video, you must understand your clients from a search perspective. 

*Don't worry if you've already started or completed the above marketing tasks, the following strategy can be implemented at any time.*

What I mean by 'search perspective', is you need to understand what terms/phrases your users are searching for. 

Introducing strategy number one; keyword research. Keyword is one of the oldest SEO strategies but it still remains one of the must important.

Keyword research involves finding out which keywords your target market is search for. Understand this helps you target these keywords, rank for them and attract your target market to your website. It also provides you with a better understanding of your customer.

Keyword research can take multiple forms and contain multiple data sets. Ultimately, though it boils down to three types of data:


<ul>
1. Queries- What queries are people searching for?  
2. Volume - How many times do people search for the term?  
3. Difficulty - How hard is it to rank for the term in search engines?  



To obtain the above data you will need a keyword research tool. There are hundreds of tools to chose from but I would recommend the following:


-Ahref (Paid)  

-SEMrush (Paid)  

-Google Keyword Planner (Free)    

-Answer the public (Free tier)  

  

For a basic overview of how to conduct keyword research, I will use Google's Keyword Planner. 

Google Keyword Planner is a tool within Google Ads. The tool's primary purpose is to provide keyword research for pay-per-click advertising but it serves our SEO keyword research needs fine.

*It's important to note that the data within Google Keyword Planner is not 100% correct, it is above 95% though.*
