# SEO basics in 2019 - How To Do SEO For Your Website

It's your SEO north star, guiding you to the peeks of search results. 

Implementing the knowledge gained within this guide will help you build a solid SEO foundation and improve your rankings in Google and Bing. 

Implementing this guide will not **guarantee** you a number one ranking on Google for your keywords. What it will do, is dramatically improve your rankings if you are not utilizing some of the strategies listed. 

I'm not here to bullshit you, I'm here to help you rank better in 2019.

Every strategy within this document was recently tested or sourced from credible sources. I can confirm these strategies will continue to blossom in 2019.

This guide is for all levels of SEO experience. If you are beginning your journey with SEO this is the perfect documentation to kickstart your SEO career. 

If you are an advanced SEO consultant, its always good to revise what you might already know - you might even learn a thing or two.

SEO is a complex subject after all, but ultimately it serves one purpose.

**Good SEO helps you attract interested users, from search engines, to your website.**

Within the above sentence, you'll notice one subject; SEO, and three entities:

1. **You**
2. **The user**
3. **The Search Engine**



Making life easier for the above three entities when implementing SEO will help you rank better on SERPs and attract users to your website. 

For this reason I have decided to structure this post slightly different to other SEO posts.

1. Make Life Easier For Yourself (Keyword research, competitor research)
2. Make Life Easier For Your Users (Design, HTTPs, Speed, User Intent, Fresh content)
3. Make Life Easier For Search Engines (Indexing, Crawling, Accessibility, Structured Data, Link Building, EAT)

So if you're game, let's get started with understanding and implementing SEO basics in 2019.



## Make Life Easier For Yourself

Before you jump into an SEO project, it's important you conduct thorough research. 

Good research helps you understand your SEO landscape better. A better understanding improves your chances of success. 

Within SEO, there are two important research strategies:

1. Keyword Research
2. Competitive Research



### Keyword Research

Keyword research involves finding out which keywords your target market is searching for. Understanding this helps you target these keywords, rank for them, and attract your target market to your website. It also provides you with a better understanding of your customer.

Keyword research can take multiple forms and contain multiple data sets. Ultimately, though it boils down to three types of data:

1. Queries- What queries are people searching for?  
2. Volume - How many times do people search for the term?  
3. Difficulty - How hard is it to rank for the term in search engines?  

#### How To Do Keyword Research

For a basic overview of how to conduct keyword research, I will use Google's Keyword Planner. 

Google Keyword Planner is a tool within Google Ads. It is sometimes referred to as GKP. GKP's primary purpose is to provide keyword research for pay-per-click advertising but it serves our basic SEO keyword research needs fine.

<u>Note: Data within Google Keyword Planner is very broad but it gives you a flavour of what keywords are popular and which are not.</u>

- Google Keyword Planner (Free)

### SEO Competitor Research

SEO competitor research is a strategy which involves researching your SEO competitors, and reviewing:

1. Content 
2. Website performance
3. Incoming links

SERPs (search engine result pages) are highly competitive arenas. Each search term can have millions of results. 

Your SEO competitors might be slightly different from your business competitors. SEO competitors are websites whom are ranking above you for your chosen keywords (from your keyword research above).



#### How To Do SEO Competitor Research

##### Step 1. Identify your keywords, and then your competitors

The first task is to identify 5 competitors. To identify your competitors, analyse which websites are ranking for your 5 primary keywords (your most important keywords). 

For each keyword SERP score the number one ranked company - 5 points, the number 2 ranked - 3 points, the number 3 ranked - 1 point. Total the points for each competitor, and VOILA! Multiple tools can do this for you, including Similar Web and SE Ranking.

Take note of the 5 companies who have the most points - these are your new SEO competitors.



##### Step 2. Technical Examination

There are three components to a quick technical examination; Speed, Security, and Mobile.

1. Speed - Check your competitor websites speed using [Google's Speed Test](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) . 
2. Security - Do your competitor have HTTPS? BuiltWith is a great tool for checking if a website has a security certificate.
3. Mobile -  [Google's mobile-friendly test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) is great tool to determine if a website is mobile optimised or not.



##### Step 3. Content Examination

Examining your competitors content is a great way to find out their strategy, their weaknesses, and your opportunities. Analyse their navigation, their blog, their meta tags, products and catergories. A great tool for this is ScreamingFrog.



##### Step 3. Backlink Analysis

Analysing your competitors backlinks brings numerous opportunities. Ahref is a great tool for backlink analysis.



##### Step 4 - Implement Changes

This is the fun part. It's time to take your competitors strengths, make them better and apply them to your own website. Over time, this should help your website and rankings perform better.



##### Step 5 - Repeat

Repeat this process on a monthly/quarterly basis. 



#### Top 5 SEO Competitor Research Tools

Many SEO tools have the capability of performing one of the steps above. There are few which can complete them all.

- Ahref (Paid)  

- ScreamingFrog (Free)

- SimilarWeb (Paid) 

- Built With (Free)

- Search Engines (Free)
