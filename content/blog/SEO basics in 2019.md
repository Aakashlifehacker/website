This post is your ultimate guide to SEO basics in 2019. Think of it as your SEO north star, guiding you to the peeks of search results in 2019. 

Implementing the knowledge gained within this guide will help you build a solid SEO foundation and improve your rankings in Google. 

Implementing this guide will not **guarantee** you a number one ranking on Google for your keywords. What it will do, is dramatically improve your rankings if you are not utilizing some of the strategies listed. 

I'm not here to bullshit you, I'm here to help you rank better in 2019.

Every strategy within this document was recently tested or sourced from credible sources. I can confirm these strategies will continue to blossom in 2019.

This guide is for all levels of SEO experience. If you are beginning your journey with SEO this is the perfect documentation to kickstart your SEO career. 

If you are an advanced SEO consultant, its always good to revise what you might already know - you might even learn a thing or two.

SEO is a complex subject after all, but ultimately it serves one purpose.

**Good SEO helps you attract interested users, from search engines, to your website.**

Within the above sentence, you'll notice one subject; SEO, and three entities:

1. You
2. The user
3. The Search Engine



Making life easier for the above three entities when implementing SEO will help you rank better on SERPs and attract users to your website.

For this reason I have decided to structure this post slightly different to other SEO posts.

1. Make Life Easier For Yourself (Keyword research, competitor research)
2. Make Life Easier For Your Users (Design, HTTPs, Speed, User Intent, Fresh content)
3. Make Life Easier For Search Engines (Indexing, Crawling, Accessibility, Structured Data, Link Building, EAT)

So if you're game, let's get started understanding and implementing DigiJo's SEO basics in 2019.



## Make Life Easier For Yourself

Before you jump into an SEO project, it's important you conduct thorough research. 

Good research helps you understand your SEO landscape better. A better understanding improves your chances of success. 

Within SEO, there are two important research strategies:

1. Keyword Research
2. Competitive Research



### Keyword Research

Keyword research involves finding out which keywords your target market is searching for. Understanding this helps you target these keywords, rank for them, and attract your target market to your website. It also provides you with a better understanding of your customer.

Keyword research can take multiple forms and contain multiple data sets. Ultimately, though it boils down to three types of data:

1. Queries- What queries are people searching for?  

2. Volume - How many times do people search for the term?  

3. Difficulty - How hard is it to rank for the term in search engines?  

   

#### How To Do Keyword Research

For a basic overview of how to conduct keyword research, I will use Google's Keyword Planner. 

Google Keyword Planner is a tool within Google Ads. It is sometimes referred to as GKP. GKP's primary purpose is to provide keyword research for pay-per-click advertising but it serves our basic SEO keyword research needs fine.

<u>Note: Data within Google Keyword Planner is very broad but it gives you a flavour of what keywords are popular and which are not.</u>



My process for keyword research is pretty straight forward and it works:

- Create 3-5 buckets related to the mission and subject of your business. DigiJo's buckets are Digital Marketing, SEO, and Web Design. 
- Under each bucket, make a list of keywords (2-5 keywords in length) relevant to your business and product. Have a primary keyword for each bucket. DigiJo's primary keywords are 'Digital Marketing Belfast', 'SEO Belfast', 'Web Design Belfast'. 
- To find keywords, use Google's Keyword Planner (GKP). Once logged into GKP, click the 'find keywords' option and add your search queries to the search bar. Ignore the search data - it's not very reliable. GKP is used to provide keyword ideas. An additional method of finding keywords is to search for your primary keyword on Google, scroll to the bottom of the SERP, and record the related search terms. 
- Analyse your keywords. GKP is not reliable. To understand search volume (avg. number of times a term is search for over a period of a month) and keyword difficulty (how hard it is to rank for the given term), you need to a tool like SEMrush. This data is key as it helps you understand which keywords are worth fighting for and which are not.

   

####DigiJo's Top 5 Keyword Research Tools

To obtain the above data you will need a keyword research tool. There are lots of tools to choose from but I would recommend the following:

- SEMrush (Paid) 
- Ahref (Paid)  
- Google Keyword Planner (Free)    
- Moz (Paid)
- Answer the public (Free tier)  



### SEO Competitor Research

SEO competitor research is a strategy which involves researching your SEO competitors, and reviewing:

1. Content 
2. Website performance
3. Incoming links

SERPs (search engine result pages) are highly competitive arenas. Each search term can have millions of results. 

Your SEO competitors might be slightly different from your business competitors. SEO competitors are websites whom are ranking above you for your chosen keywords (from your keyword research above).



#### How To Do SEO Competitor Research



##### Step 1. Identify your keywords, and then your competitors

The first task is to identify 5 competitors. To identify your competitors, analyse which websites are ranking for your 5 primary keywords (your most important keywords). 

For each keyword SERP score the number one ranked company - 5 points, the number 2 ranked - 3 points, the number 3 ranked - 1 point. Total the points for each competitor, and VOILA! Multiple tools can do this for you, including Similar Web and SE Ranking.

Take note of the 5 companies who have the most points - these are your new SEO competitors.



##### Step 2. Technical Examination

There are three components to a quick technical examination; Speed, Security, and Mobile.

1. Speed - Check your competitor websites speed using [Google's Speed Test](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) . 
2. Security - Do your competitor have HTTPS? BuiltWith is a great tool for checking if a website has a security certificate.
3. Mobile -  [Google's mobile-friendly test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) is great tool to determine if a website is mobile optimised or not.



##### Step 3. Content Examination

Examining your competitors content is a great way to find out their strategy, their weaknesses, and your opportunities. Analyse their navigation, their blog, their meta tags, products and catergories. A great tool for this is ScreamingFrog.



##### Step 4. Backlink Analysis

Analysing your competitors backlinks brings numerous opportunities. Ahref is a great tool for backlink analysis.



##### Step 5 - Implement Changes

This is the fun part. It's time to take your competitors strengths, make them better and apply them to your own website. Over time, this should help your website and rankings perform better.



##### Step 6 - Repeat

Repeat this process on a monthly/quarterly basis. 



#### DigiJo's SEO Competitor Research Tools

Many SEO tools have the capability of performing one of the steps above. There are few which can complete them all.

- Ahref (Paid)  

- ScreamingFrog (Free)

- SimilarWeb (Paid) 

- Built With (Free)

- Search Engines (Free)




## Make Life Easier For Your Users

Your website users are customers, new employees, LEADS! It makes sense to provide them with a great experience, when visiting your website. 

Search engines, including Google agree with this sentiment. They also want to ensure their users have the best experience possible. This includes the user's experience on your website. This is why, the likes of Google have ranking factors dedicated to the experience your provide to your users.

If you provide your users with a bad web experience, they're not going to stick around. There are multiple ranking factors used by search engines to ensure your website is providing users with a great experience. I've listed these below:



#### Responsive Web design (Be Mobile)

Responsive web design is the process of designing a website which provides the user with a seamless experience across different sized devices. 

This is done using CSS. CSS can detect the screen size of the device and will structure the HTML accordingly.

Responsive web design is a key Google ranking factor. More importantly, responsive web design improves user experience, convert leads, and improve engagement.

In early 2018, Google introducedÂ [Mobile First Indexing](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html). To summarise, Google is taking mobile very serious. So serious, they're mostly ranking your pages based on your mobile site. 

**Top tip, serve the same html and content to both desktop and mobile users.**



#### How to make your website responsive

In 2019, you must have a website that is optimised for mobile. If your website is not optimised, quickly visit DigiJo's [web design services](https://www.digijo.co.uk/belfast-web-design) . There are lots of great web designers in Belfast, you're truly spoilt for choice.

#### **HTTPS (Call Security)**  

As you can probably guess, the S at the end of HTTPS means security -  (Hypertext Transport Protocol Security). HTTPS websites have an an additional layer of security over HTTP websites. This extra layer is obtained through an SSL certificate. It's the SSL certificate which activities the tiny padlock and HTTPs.

Websites without HTTPs are now labelled 'not secure'. HTTPs protects your users against man-in-the-middle attacks. On top of that, Google outlined HTTPs provides a ranking boost over websites without it. In 2019, you need a secure website. Luckily, it's not very hard to secure your website.



#### How to add HTTPs to your website

To add HTTPs to you website, simply contact your hosting provider and ask them to add an SSL certificate to your website. This might come with a small fee.

Hosting providers such as Netlify, they automatically secure your website with HTTPs.



#### Tools for HTTPs

Lets Encrypt

Netlify





### Website Speed 

There's a huge need for speed in the search world.

Speed is a key element of SEO. From 2018, it is key [ranking factor](https://searchengineland.com/google-speed-update-page-speed-will-become-ranking-factor-mobile-search-289904) in mobile search. Since the 2018 'Google Speed Update', there are clear correlations between speed and rankings.

A fast website is also better for your users. The fast paced world we live in, hates slow loading web pages - it's a personal pet hate.

In a recent study byÂ [Akamai](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/), they reported 50% of users expect a site to load in under 2 seconds. If the site does not load within 3 seconds, your users tend to exit.

Pretty scary statistic, right?

Thankfully, there are multiple ways to speed up your website, improving user experience.



#### How To Improve Your Website Speed

To improve your website speed, you first need to run a performance audit. For performance audits, you can use [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) or Google's Lighthouse.  I use Lighthouse as it take's a user-focused approach to the audit.

To use Lighthouse, add the extension to Chrome: [Google Lighthouse Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/lighthouse).

You can now run a Lighthouse audit on any website by simple clicking the extension button in your browser. Once Lighthouse has performed the audit, it will provide you with scores and actions to improve those scores. Research these actions further, and implement the advised changes.



On top of the actions provided by Lighthouse, I've listed two additional suggestions. These suggestions will take your website to a new level - think Formula 1 of the website world.



##### Using a Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of servers which hold cached versions of your content. These servers are spread out across the world. This geographical dispersion ensures your content is stored closer to the user. The closer the server is to the user, the quicker the user will receive the content.

Popular CDNs include [Cloudfare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The DigiJo website uses Netlify.



##### Go Static

Static websites are generally faster than dynamic websites. After all, static websites do not have the added weight of a database/CMS.

A great way of developing a static website is to use a Static Site Generator (SSG). The DigiJo website uses an SSG called [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
