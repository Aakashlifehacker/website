      <description>It was the year 2010, I had an idea for a web application which would allow my family and I to share images, organise shopping, populate a shared calendar, and store bills. My family was horribly organised. We needed this!
Obiously, my idea was going to make me millions of $$$s. Perfect! I thought.
There was a small complication with my vision - I didn&#39;t know how to build a web application.</description>

  In this post, I’m going to show you EXACTLY how to make a web app.
In fact, this is the process I’ve used, revised and perfected over the last 5 years.
I’ve used this exact process, or a version of it to build over 15 applications of all shapes and sizes. For me, this is 100% the best way to build web applications.</description>

      <description>With Chrome 72, you can now publish your PWA in the Play Store and from the browser.
Chrome 72 was shipped in November 2018 and included Tursted Web Activity (TWA) which allows you to open Chrome in standalone mode thanks to your native Android package.
The primary advantages over your normal PWA installation are:
  Home screen widget
  Offer a wear OS companion app
  Background services can access native features</description>
