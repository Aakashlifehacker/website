        <p>Web design is a popular digital component of design, where electronic files are compiled and presented over the internet. It’s often mixed up with web development. As a Belfast web designer talking to a fellow enthusiast, I think it’s important to explain the difference between web design and web development. Web design consists of the defining the look and feel of a website. Web development involves turning those designs into a live website. At DigiJo, I provide you with both services, and I do it with attention and quality.

        <p class="project-card__description">Hugo is the world's fastest framework for building websites. It really is lightning fast - it's built on top of Google's programming language Go. Hugo is an SSG (Static Website Generator). An SSG is a framework which compiles static files and outputs a website.<br><br>
          Hugo is also extremely flexible. With Hugo, I will code your website from the ground up, making it completely bespoke. Your website, your design!<br><br>
          Static webites are extremely easy to manage. They do not require updating, unlike WordPress which requires updating roughly every month. With Hugo, your website can sit for years without updating and perform perfectly.

        <p class="project-card__description">Gatsby is a static PWA generator for React. PWA stands for progressive web app. A progressive web app use modern technologies to deliver websites which are also apps. With a PWA you get a website and an app so your users can download your website and use it offline!<br><br>
          Gatsby is leading the way in the PWA generator market. It's fast, secure and combines with modern technologies to offer a great environment for building modern websites.  <br><br>
          PWAs are the future of web design and I'm happy to futureproof your digital presence. I can even add WordPress to your Gatsby website, making it easier to edit. I'm truly excited by this technology and you should be too.</p>
